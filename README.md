##Coromandel

###About
A Coromandel Screen is a wooden folding screen coated in dark lacquer that is carved before being painted with gold or varied colors. Some may be decorated with precious stones. (<a href="http://quezi.com/3679" target="new">Source</a>)

Coromandel, the tool, was designed to isolate an individual cloud server instance for analysis so that it may be investigated without fear of introducing addtional  artifacts not explicitly introduced by the responder and their tools.

###Usage
